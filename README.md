# Inspiration ‚ú®
Current metaverse platforms have following limitation:

### Entry-Barrier: 
Entry cost is prohibitively expensive in current metaverse platforms.Even for hosting events you have to rent or buy land.

### Invite-Only Events:
Current metaverses do not allow users to host invite-only events as a result use-cases of metaverse drop significantly.

### Fast On Chain Payment:
We used ICON to accomplish this.

# Usability ‚òòÔ∏è
